# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the KIDS24-team14 biohackathon project repository. The codebase is currently in early stages of development.

## Repository Status

This repository is newly initialized. As the project develops, this file should be updated to include:
- Build and test commands once the tech stack is established
- Architecture decisions and key design patterns
- Development workflow and contribution guidelines
- Any project-specific conventions or constraints

## Next Steps for Development

When adding code to this repository, establish:
1. The technology stack and programming language(s)
2. Project structure and directory layout
3. Build system and dependency management
4. Testing framework and approach
5. Development and deployment workflows

Update this CLAUDE.md file as these decisions are made to help future contributors understand the project.
